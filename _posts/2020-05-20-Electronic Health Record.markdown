In the Fall semester of 2017, I took a Data Science course as a master's student in biostatistics. We mainly programmed in R and integrated that with Github. As a final group project for the course, I collaborated with two other master's students who are also interested in analyzing public health data to produce the following deliverables:

- Two-minute screencast with narration (watch below).
- [Public website](https://katwang.github.io/BST-260-Final-Project-Site/) as a quick summary of our project and main findings, created using Github Pages.
- Full [analysis report](https://euniceyeh.github.io/EHR-Project/) compiled in bookdown, detailing the entire project process.
- Our project's [Github repo](https://github.com/euniceyeh/EHR-Project) containing all the code to the bookdown and analyses.
